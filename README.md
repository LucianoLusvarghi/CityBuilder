# INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMING ACADEMIC PROJECT in Unity

## The project consists of the fundamental mechanics of a City Builder, where the elements to highlight are:

**Path Finding**: The A* algorithm is used, employing a thread system for simultaneous execution of several instances of Path Finding.

**The buildings**: Based on a multi-agent system, where each building is an agent, the NPCs are part of the building.

**Save / Load**: BinaryFormatter has been used for this whole process.

**Metrics**: Buildings are what inform a common system when they consume or create an item.

**Fires (event)**: Buildings likely to suffer this event register themselves to the event.

*All programming code used in the project is self-created.*
